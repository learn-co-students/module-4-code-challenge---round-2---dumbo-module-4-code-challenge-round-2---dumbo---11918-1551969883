# Module 4 Code Challenge

#### Today, you will be building a Beer App 🍺🍺🍺

<!-- ### Step 1

-- As a user, when the page loads, I should see a list of beer names retrieved from an API on the right hand side of the screen.

### Step 2

-- As a user, when I click a beer name, the application should reveal more information about that particular beer.

### Step 3

-- As a user, I can filter through the beer list by typing the name of a beer in the search input -->

<!-- AND DONE. -->
